        Disclosure: The following terms and disclaimers cover all data and
        information (“Corporate Information”) posted by Corporate Communication
        Users (“Corporate Users”) of the Corporate Communication Service (the
        “Service”) on the mobile application, desktop application, website, and
        any other product or service (collectively, “Applications”) provided by
        Bulloak Technologies Pte. Ltd. and its affiliates (“Bulloak”). Corporate
        Information includes, but is not limited to, market data, fundamental
        data such as financial reports, analysis, corporate actions, news
        reports, product launches, general commentary, social media posts, press
        releases and earnings releases. The Service is provided to Corporate
        Users who have been authorized by Bulloak to post Corporate Information
        on the Bulloak Applications.
        <br />
        Bulloak is not involved in preparing or editing, nor does it explicitly
        or implicitly endorse or approve any Corporate Information posted by
        Corporate Users. Bulloak does not explicitly or implicitly endorse or
        approve the Corporate Information posted by Corporate Users of the
        Service. The Corporate Information posted by Corporate Users does not
        constitute the provision by Bulloak of investment advice nor the
        advocacy for the purchase or sale of any security or investment nor does
        Bulloak guarantee the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness
        of any Corporate Information. Bulloak bears no legal liability for any
        loss or damage arising from the delay, error, inaccuracy, or omission of
        any Corporate Information.
        <br />
        Viewers of the Corporate Information are solely responsible for the
        consequences of any actions taken in response to the Corporate
        Information and Bulloak does not bear any legal liability for such
        actions. The Corporate Information should be used in accordance with the
        policies of Bulloak as well as applicable local laws, rules, and
        regulations. No content on Bulloak’s Applications, including the
        Corporate Information, may be reproduced, stored, modified, transmitted,
        or distributed in any form or by any means (including digital,
        electronic, mechanical, photocopy, recording or otherwise), without the
        prior written permission of Bulloak. Bulloak does not bear legal
        liability for any malfunction of the user’s own network or device, or
        for any delay, suspension or interruption of the Corporate Information
        disseminated by the Corporate Users.
        <br />
        Bulloak does not bear any legal liability for service interruptions or
        losses to the user due to a “force majeure” event, such as a flood,
        extraordinary weather conditions, earthquake or other act of God, fire,
        war, insurrection, riot, labor dispute, accident, government action,
        communications or power failure, equipment, or software malfunction or
        pandemic or other health emergency.
        <br />
        Bulloak will make all reasonable efforts to notify users of the Service
        in advance of service interruptions caused by system maintenance and
        updates and retains the right to suspend or terminate part of or the
        whole of its network services without prior notice. Bulloak does not
        bear any legal liability for any loss arising from any service
        interruption, suspension or termination. Third-party posts provided on
        Bulloak’s Applications, including Corporate Information, do not reflect
        the views of Bulloak. Bulloak product features are designed for
        informational purposes only and are not intended to serve as
        recommendations to customers to buy, sell or hold any securities.
        <br />
        All investments involve risk, and the past performance of any security
        or financial product does not guarantee future results or returns. While
        diversification may help spread risk, it does not assure a profit or
        protect against loss. There is always the potential to lose money when
        you invest in securities or other financial products. Investors should
        consider their investment objectives and risks carefully before
        investing.
